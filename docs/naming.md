# Naming
This document outlines all the naming conventions to be followed.

## TLDR
> Primitive Data Type : `snake_case`

> Functions : `camelCase`

> Classes : `PascalCase`

> Folders in **Home** or **/~** or Windows from root up to **C:\Users\Username**: `PascalCase`

> Folders anywhere else: `snake_case`

## Sets
Sets are defined as an entity that is capable to store information and or process.

Here, a term called `set level` is used to differentiate the types of sets. 

A set with a higher `set level` generally means that it is a set that consists of **strictly multiple** different types of sets with a lower `set level` than itself.
> Notice that in this case, an array of a set with a given `set level` of `n` has a `set level` of `n`.

> If a set contains multiple sets of different `set levels`, the `set level` of that set is one above the highest `set level` that it contains.

### Set Level 0a: Primitive Data Types

> Use `snake_case` to define `level 0a sets`. 

Sets with a `set level` of `0a` contains a data type that cannot be broken down into user-defined components and or methods. 

> notice that in this case, even though methods exist for primitive data types in certain programming languages such as `python` or `js`, they are not user defined. As such, this rule still follows.

In most cases, this includes `primitive data types`, which can only be broken down into bits (or in the case of strings, into bytes of characters).

> `level 0a sets` are defined by their nature to be `unclassable`, this means that the information inside `level 0a sets` cannot be assigned a custom identifier or name by the programmer.

Even though the call to the set may be defined via a function, as long as it resulted with the set being assigned a `level 0a set`, follow the convention.

```python
my_python_var = 3
```
```js
const my_js_str = useRef('Intercogni')
```
```cpp
std::vector<std::string> my_cpp_vec = {"hello", "world"};
```

### Set Level 0b: Functions
> Use `camelCase` to define `level 0b sets`.

Sets with a `set level` of `0b` contains a process/execution that cannot be broken down into user-defined components and or methods.

> notice that in this case, even though methods exist for non-class functions in certain programming languages such as `python` or `js`, they are not user defined. As such, this rule still follows.

Sets with a `set level` of `0b` includes non-class functions.

```python
def pythonAdderFunc(num_a, num_b):
    return num_a + num_b
```
> notice that this convention disobeys python's function naming convention, proceed.

```js
const myJsLambdaAdderFunc = (num_a, num_b) => {
    return num_a + num_b
}
```
```cpp
void cppHelloRepeater(int count) {
    for (int i = 0; i < count; ++i) {
        std::cout << "hello ";
    } std::cout << std::endl;
}
```

### Set Level 1: Classes
> Use `Pascal_Case` to define `level 1 sets`.

Sets with a `set level` of 1 contains information and or processes that **can** be broken down into user-defined components and or methods.

Sets with a `set level` of 1 includes class and or dictionaries.

```python
class PythonClass():
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def getName():
        print(self.name)
```

```js
const [JsMsg, setJsMsg] = useState({
    title: "js msg",
    msg_type: "formal",
    data: "lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur..."
})
```

```cpp
class CppClass {
public:
    void Shout() {
        std::cout << "HELLO EVERYONE" << std::endl;
    }
};
```
